### Anomaly_detection

The attached archive contains two datasets; trainingData.csv and testingData.csv. trainingData consists of only records belonging to class 1, whereas testingData consists of both classes 0 and 1.

The data contains 244 columns, labeled from C001 to C244. The final column (C244) is the class label.

The objective is to use the trainingData to generate a bi-classifier.
